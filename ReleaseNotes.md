Gives information about tolerado releases

# Release 1.1 #
  * Added Support for Enterprise WSDL
  * Overhauled the Tolerado framework to allow plug and play behavior of enterprise,partner, metadata and apex wsdls. So those who are working only on partner, don't need to carry extraneous stuff for apex, metadata or enterprise wsdls.
  * Simplified the Stub creation mechanism and caching behavior. Just instantiate new stub with credentials, caching will work transparently.
  * Fixed session error handling issues.

# Release 1.0 #
